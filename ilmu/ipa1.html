        <h2>Temputure - Answer #1 to #4</h2>
        <p>Temperature is the measure of hotness or coldness expressed in terms of any of several scales.</p> 
        <p>Temperature is measured with a thermometer. It reflects the average kinetic energy of the vibrating and colliding atoms making up a substance.</p>
        <p>The difference between heat and Temperature is The heat of an object is the total energy of all the molecular motion inside that object but</p> 
        <p>Temperature is the measure of the thermal energy or average heat of the molecules in a substance.</p>
